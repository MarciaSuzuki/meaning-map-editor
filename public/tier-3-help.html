    <h1>Tier 2 Categories Guide</h1>
<p><strong>Meaning Map Editor • Tripod Ontology v5.4</strong></p>
<p>This guide explains the categories that require human judgment—the fields that cannot be automatically filled from the Hebrew text database. These are where your insight as an analyst makes the difference.</p>
<hr />
<h2>How to Use This Guide</h2>
<p>Each category includes: (1) a simple definition, (2) the available values, and (3) a biblical example showing how to apply it. When in doubt, choose "not_specified"—it is always better to leave a field blank than to guess wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: The pre-fill engine handles WHO, WHAT, and basic WHEN/WHERE. Your job is to add the WHY, HOW IT FEELS, and WHAT IT MEANS.</p>

<p>The meaning of a person's name, but <strong>only when the text activates it</strong>—through wordplay, explicit etymology, or narrative irony. Do NOT fill this for every name.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 1:20</strong> — Naomi (meaning "Pleasant") says "Call me Mara (Bitter)." → The name meaning is activated. Fill in: "Pleasant" for Naomi.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Genesis 25:26</strong> — "His name was called Jacob (meaning 'heel-grabber')." → The name meaning is activated by the birth narrative.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h1>2. Participant Relations</h1>
<p>Relations connect participants to each other. They answer: "How is person A related to person B?" Always specify direction (who → whom).</p>
<hr />
<h2>Kinship Relations</h2>
<p>Family connections by blood or marriage.</p>
<p><strong>Values:</strong> parent_of, child_of, spouse_of, husband_of, wife_of, sibling_of, grandparent_of, grandchild_of, ancestor_of, descendant_of, in_law, clan_member, not_specified, other</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 1:4</strong> — "Naomi's sons took Moabite wives." → Mahlon <strong>husband_of</strong> Ruth; Ruth <strong>wife_of</strong> Mahlon; Naomi <strong>in_law</strong> of Ruth.</p>
<p>Tip: Kinship relations are directional. "Naomi is mother-in-law of Ruth" means Naomi → Ruth with "in_law". Ruth → Naomi would also be "in_law" (from the other side).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Social Relations</h2>
<p>Non-family social connections—authority, allegiance, friendship.</p>
<p><strong>Values:</strong> ruler_of, subject_of, master_of, servant_of, ally_of, enemy_of, friend_of, teacher_of, student_of, colleague_of, not_specified, other</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>2 Kings 5:1</strong> — "Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Aram." → Naaman <strong>subject_of</strong> the king of Aram.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>1 Samuel 18:1</strong> — "Jonathan became one in spirit with David." → Jonathan <strong>friend_of</strong> David.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Possession Relations</h2>
<p>Ownership and control over things or people.</p>
<p><strong>Values:</strong> owner_of, possesses, belongs_to, controls, lacks, not_specified, other</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 4:3</strong> — "Naomi is selling the piece of land that belonged to Elimelech." → The land <strong>belongs_to</strong> Elimelech (originally); Naomi <strong>possesses</strong> it now.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Spatial Relations</h2>
<p>Where someone is from or where they live.</p>
<p><strong>Values:</strong> located_at, native_of, inhabitant_of, from_place, near, far_from, not_specified, other</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 1:1</strong> — "A man from Bethlehem in Judah." → Elimelech <strong>from_place</strong> Bethlehem; <strong>native_of</strong> Judah.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Part-Whole Relations</h2>
<p>How individuals relate to groups, or parts to wholes.</p>
<p><strong>Values:</strong> part_of, whole_of, member_of, group_of, substance_of, not_specified, other</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 1:2</strong> — "Ephrathites from Bethlehem." → Elimelech <strong>member_of</strong> Ephrathites (a clan).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h1>3. Non-Event Clauses &amp; Modifiers</h1>
<p>Not every clause describes an action. Some clauses simply identify, classify, or describe. These need different roles than action clauses.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Non-Event Roles</h2>
<p>For verbless clauses (identification, classification, attribution, existential), use these roles instead of semantic roles like initiator/affected.</p>
<p><strong>Values:</strong> subject, predicate, domain, location, not_specified, other</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 1:2</strong> — "The name of the man was Elimelech." → Clause type: <strong>identification</strong>. Subject: "the name of the man"; Predicate: "Elimelech".</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 1:2</strong> — "Ephrathites from Bethlehem." → Clause type: <strong>classification</strong>. Subject: (the family); Predicate: "Ephrathites".</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Evidentiality</h2>
<p>How did the speaker or narrator know this information? This is important for languages that grammatically mark the source of knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Values:</strong> witnessed_visual, witnessed_sensory, reported, inferred, assumed, general_knowledge, divine_revelation, unspecified, not_specified, other</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Genesis 22:12</strong> — "Now I know that you fear God." → God says this after <strong>witnessing</strong> Abraham's actions → <strong>witnessed_visual</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>2 Kings 5:8</strong> — "Elisha heard that the king had torn his robes." → Elisha learned by <strong>reported</strong> information.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Duration</h2>
<p>How long does the event or state last?</p>
<p><strong>Values:</strong> point (instant), bounded (has an end), unbounded (ongoing), not_specified, other</p>
<p><strong>Duration Precision:</strong> exact, approximate, vague, not_specified, other</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 1:4</strong> — "They lived there about ten years." → <strong>bounded</strong> (ten years is a defined period). Precision: <strong>approximate</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 1:3</strong> — "Elimelech died." → <strong>point</strong> (death is instantaneous).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h1>4. Discourse &amp; Pragmatics</h1>
<p>These categories describe how clauses fit together to tell the story—the flow, emphasis, and structure of the narrative.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Discourse Relations</h2>
<p>How does this clause connect to the previous one? What logical relationship ties them?</p>
<p><strong>Values:</strong> sequence, simultaneous, cause, result, purpose, condition, contrast, concession, clarification, elaboration, evidence, restatement, additive, resumption, not_specified, other</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 1:1</strong> — "There was a famine... so a man went to Moab." → The famine is the <strong>cause</strong>; the migration is the <strong>result</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 1:1-2</strong> — "A man went... The name of the man was Elimelech." → The second clause is an <strong>elaboration</strong> of the first.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Information Structure: Topic &amp; Focus</h2>
<p><strong>Topic:</strong> What the clause is about (the "given" information).
<strong>Focus:</strong> The new or important information.</p>
<p><strong>Topic values:</strong> unmarked, marked_topic, contrastive_topic, not_specified, other</p>
<p><strong>Focus values:</strong> unmarked, new_info_focus, contrastive_focus, not_specified, other</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 1:3</strong> — "וַיָּמָת אֱלִימֶלֶךְ" (And Elimelech died). → Elimelech is topic (we know him); "died" is <strong>new_info_focus</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 1:5</strong> — "וַיָּמוּתוּ גַם־שְׁנֵיהֶם" (And both of them also died). → "גַם" (also/even) marks <strong>contrastive_focus</strong>—emphasizing the tragedy.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Formulaic Marker</h2>
<p>Is this a stock phrase or formula common in biblical literature?</p>
<p><strong>Values:</strong> formulaic, non_formulaic, not_specified, other</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 1:1</strong> — "וַיְהִי בִּימֵי" (And it was in the days of...) → <strong>formulaic</strong> (standard narrative opening; cf. Genesis 14:1, Judges 17:6).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Peak Event</h2>
<p>Mark exactly ONE clause as the peak—the climax, turning point, or most important moment in the pericope. Only one per pericope!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 1:1-5</strong> — The peak is Ruth 1:5: "Both Mahlon and Kilion also died." This is the lowest point that sets up the entire story.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Thematic Spine</h2>
<p>Write a ONE-SENTENCE summary of what this pericope is about. This helps taggers in the Language Archive find similar stories.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 1:1-5</strong> — "A family flees famine but loses everything, leaving a widow alone in a foreign land."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Social Axis</h2>
<p>In speech or interaction: who holds power? What is the social dynamic?</p>
<p><strong>Values:</strong> equal_to_equal, superior_to_inferior, inferior_to_superior, divine_to_human, human_to_divine, formal_public, intimate_private, not_specified, other</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 2:10</strong> — Ruth bows before Boaz and asks why he noticed her. → <strong>inferior_to_superior</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Prominence</h2>
<p>How important is this clause in the narrative?</p>
<p><strong>Values:</strong> peak, high, medium, low, not_specified, other</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 1:5</strong> — "Both of them died." → Prominence: <strong>peak</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Pacing</h2>
<p>How fast is the narrative moving?</p>
<p><strong>Values:</strong> summary, normal, slow, pause, not_specified, other</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 1:4</strong> — "They lived there about ten years." → Pacing: <strong>summary</strong> (ten years compressed into one clause).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Focalization</h2>
<p>Whose perspective are we seeing the story from?</p>
<p><strong>Values:</strong> narrator_external (objective, from outside), narrator_aligned (sympathetic to a character), character_internal (from inside a character's mind), not_specified, other</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 1:20</strong> — Naomi speaks about her bitterness. → <strong>character_internal</strong> (we hear her inner feelings).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h1>5. Emotion &amp; Source Tracking</h1>
<p>These categories capture the emotional texture of the text and help us be transparent about how we know what we claim to know.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Emotion Type</h2>
<p>What emotion is present in this clause? Consider the speaker, the affected party, or the narrator's tone.</p>
<p><strong>Positive:</strong> joy, hope, gratitude, love, compassion, peace, trust, relief, awe, pride, contentment, desire, zeal</p>
<p><strong>Negative:</strong> sorrow, fear, anger, disgust, shame, guilt, despair, anxiety, loneliness, jealousy, resentment, bitterness</p>
<p><strong>Mixed/Complex:</strong> awe_fear, reverence, remorse, longing</p>
<p><strong>Other:</strong> not_specified, other</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 1:9</strong> — Naomi kisses her daughters-in-law; they weep. → <strong>sorrow</strong>, possibly <strong>love</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Emotion Intensity</h2>
<p>How strong is the emotion?</p>
<p><strong>Values:</strong> low, medium, high, extreme, not_specified, other</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 1:14</strong> — "They wept again" → <strong>high</strong>. <strong>Ruth 1:20</strong> — Naomi says God dealt bitterly → <strong>extreme</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Narrator Stance</h2>
<p>What is the narrator's attitude toward what is being reported?</p>
<p><strong>Values:</strong> neutral (just reporting), sympathetic (with the character), critical (against), ironic (opposite of surface meaning), celebratory, lamenting, didactic (teaching), suspenseful, not_specified, other</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 1:1-5</strong> — The narrator reports the deaths without editorial comment. → <strong>neutral</strong> or <strong>lamenting</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Audience Response</h2>
<p>What response is the text trying to evoke in the reader/hearer?</p>
<p><strong>Values:</strong> empathy, sympathy, admiration, disapproval, fear, hope, relief, grief, joy, conviction, not_specified, other</p>
<hr />
<h2>Inference Source</h2>
<p>When you tag something that isn't explicitly stated, record HOW you know it.</p>
<p><strong>Values:</strong> lexical (word meaning), contextual (surrounding text), cultural (background knowledge), behavioral (actions imply feelings), physiological (weeping = sadness), speech_content, narrator_comment, reader_inference, theological, not_specified, other</p>
<hr />
<h2>Confidence Level</h2>
<p>How confident are you in this interpretation?</p>
<p><strong>Values:</strong> high, medium, low, speculative, not_specified, other</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Tagging Naomi with "sorrow" in Ruth 1:5:
- Inference source: <strong>contextual</strong> + <strong>behavioral</strong> (she just lost her sons)
- Confidence: <strong>high</strong> (it's clear from context)</p>
<p>Tip: Source Tracking is crucial for quality control. It forces you to ask: "Am I reading this into the text, or is it really there?"</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h1>6. Speech Acts &amp; Figurative Language</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Speech Acts</h2>
<p>When someone speaks, what are they DOING with their words? This is different from what they literally say.</p>
<p><strong>Values:</strong>
- <strong>assertive</strong> — claiming something is true

<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 1:17</strong> — "May the LORD do so to me and more also." → <strong>oath</strong> (calling God as witness to a commitment).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Figurative Language</h2>
<p>Non-literal language—when words mean something other than their plain sense.</p>
<p><strong>Values:</strong>
- <strong>metaphor</strong> — A is B ("The LORD is my shepherd")
- <strong>simile</strong> — A is like B ("Like a tree planted by streams")
- <strong>metonymy</strong> — Related thing stands for the thing ("The sword shall devour" = war)
- <strong>synecdoche</strong> — Part for whole or whole for part

</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Figurative Transferability</h2>
<p>How easily can this figure of speech be understood across cultures?</p>
<p><strong>Values:</strong> universal (most cultures get it), common (many cultures), limited (some cultures), culture_specific (needs explanation), language_specific (wordplay that doesn't translate), not_specified, other</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> "The hand of the LORD" → <strong>common</strong> (many cultures personify divine action).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> "Jacob" meaning "heel-grabber" → <strong>language_specific</strong> (Hebrew wordplay).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h1>7. Key Terms &amp; Retrieval Tags</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Key Term Domains</h2>
<p>Some words carry heavy theological or cultural meaning. Tag them with their domain so the system can find validated translations in the Concept Bank.</p>

</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Key Term Consistency</h2>
<p>Should this term be translated the same way every time?</p>
<p><strong>Values:</strong> always (same word every time), preferred (usually the same), flexible (context determines), not_specified, other</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> "חֶסֶד" (hesed / steadfast love / loyalty) → <strong>preferred</strong> (important to be consistent, but context may require flexibility).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Language Archive Retrieval Tags</h2>
<p>Free-form tags that help match this clause with similar content in the Language Archive. Think: "What tags would help a tagger find a community story like this?"</p>
<p><strong>Tag categories:</strong> emotion_tags, event_tags, register_tags, discourse_tags, social_tags, poetic_tags, parallelism_tags, proverb_tags, formulaic_tags</p>
<p>(Values are free text tags you create)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 1:1</strong> (the journey clause):
- event_tags: journey_story, migration_narrative
- social_tags: alien_sojourn, displacement</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Ruth 1:5</strong> (the death clause):
- emotion_tags: grief, loss
- event_tags: death_narrative</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h1>8. Poetry &amp; Wisdom Features</h1>
<p>These categories apply mainly to poetic texts (Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Song of Songs, prophetic oracles) and wisdom literature. Skip them for narrative prose.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Parallelism Type</h2>
<p>Hebrew poetry builds meaning by pairing lines. The second line relates to the first.</p>
<p><strong>Values:</strong>
- <strong>synonymous</strong> — B says the same as A in different words

- <strong>synthetic</strong> — B extends or completes A
- <strong>climactic</strong> — B intensifies A
- <strong>emblematic</strong> — One line is figurative, one literal
- <strong>chiastic</strong> — A-B-B'-A' pattern
- <strong>staircase</strong> — Repetition with addition
- <strong>none</strong> — No parallelism
- not_specified, other</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <strong>Psalm 1:6</strong> — "The LORD watches over the way of the righteous, / but the way of the wicked leads to destruction." → <strong>antithetical</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Line Structure</h2>
<p>How many parts does this poetic unit have?</p>

<h1>Final Reminders</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>When in doubt, choose "not_specified."</strong> Sparse accurate tagging is always better than dense speculative tagging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use "other" sparingly.</strong> If you use "other" repeatedly for the same concept, tell your supervisor—it may indicate a gap in the ontology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trust your reading.</strong> You were trained for this. If the text makes you feel something, that's data. Tag it and note your confidence level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The goal is retrieval.</strong> Every tag you add helps the system find matching expressions in the Language Archive. Think: "What would help someone find a similar story?"</p>
